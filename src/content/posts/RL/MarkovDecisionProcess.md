Markov Decision Process (MDP) almost defines the standard format of the reinforcement learning. With the symbolic representation, almost any problem can be transfered to the MDP. Learning the reinforcement, MDP is the best start. 

# Definition of Reinforcement Learning

The direct neural network training process, always feeds the data to the model directly. The target is to improve its perceptibility (like CNN) instead of the decision-making capability. The Reinforcement Learning (RL) showed up to make the agent learn from the feedback from the enviroment. With the reward from the enviroment, the dicision made by the agent can gradually meet the human's expectation. In machine learning area, with a trainable agent, we hope it can find the optimal strategies to the certain decision problem. 

Formulaically, all the reinforcement learning can be seen as a MDP. The solution to such scenario, is also the solution of the RL.

Formally, a MDP is a 4-tuple ($S,A,P_a, R_a$)[^1], where:
